# Project Card — Multimodal Disaster Damage Assessment

**Goal:** Explore a two-stage (hierarchical) pipeline for disaster assessment:
1) **CrisisMMD v2.0** — classify crisis tweets (text + attached photos)
2) **BRIGHT** — segment damaged buildings from post-event satellite imagery

**Why it matters:** Social media is fast but noisy; satellite imagery is slower but spatially complete.
A hierarchical workflow can triage events quickly and then map damage at scale.

See `README.md` for full details.
