DATASET ACCESS & DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
Project: Multi-Modal Disaster Damage Assessment
============================================================

This project uses TWO public datasets:

1. CrisisMMD (Twitter-based multi-modal crisis dataset)
2. BRIGHT (Building Damage Assessment from Satellite Imagery)

Due to licensing and storage constraints, the datasets are NOT included 
inside the submitted ZIP file. Follow the instructions below to download 
them and prepare them in the required folder structure.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. CRISIS-MMD DATASET
------------------------------------------------------------

Official repo:
https://github.com/CrisisMMD/CrisisMMD

Direct download:
https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/crisismmd

You need the following components:
    • all_json/            (tweet metadata)
    • image/               (tweet images)
    • tsv/                 (labels for informativeness, humanitarian category)

Place them in:

CrisisMMD/
    all_json/
    image/
    tsv/

NOTE:
- Some TSV files have non-UTF8 characters. The notebook already handles 
  encoding gracefully.
- No modifications are required other than placing the folders correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. BRIGHT DATASET
------------------------------------------------------------

Official BRIGHT release:
https://zenodo.org/records/15385983

GitHub Link:
https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT

Download the following subsets:
    • post-event/          (post-disaster satellite imagery)
    • target/              (pixel-level building damage masks)
    • (optional) pre-event/  [Our project does NOT require pre-event images]

Place them in:

BRIGHT/
    post-event/
    target/
    pre-event/   (optional — many scenes do not include pre-images)

Total size: approx. 20–25 GB depending on mirrors.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. VERIFY FOLDER STRUCTURE (IMPORTANT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Your project root should look like this:

ProjectRoot/
    CrisisMMD/
        all_json/
        image/
        tsv/

    BRIGHT/
        post-event/
        target/
        pre-event/   (optional)

    code/
    models/
    logs/
    sample_outputs/
    README.md
    …

If the datasets are not placed exactly this way, the notebooks will not 
be able to locate the files and preprocessing will fail.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. RUNNING THE NOTEBOOKS AFTER DOWNLOADING
------------------------------------------------------------

CrisisMMD notebook:
    • Expects "CrisisMMD/" folder directly under project root.
    • Will parse JSON and TSV metadata.
    • Preprocessing will automatically skip corrupt files.

BRIGHT notebook:
    • Expects "BRIGHT/" folder directly under project root.
    • Will build a manifest of post-event + label files.
    • Will generate tiles automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. STORAGE WARNING
------------------------------------------------------------

BRIGHT imagery and generated tile artifacts can exceed 30–40 GB 
depending on your setup. The ZIP submission intentionally excludes these.

If you need to reduce storage:
    • Delete artifacts_stage2/ after training.
    • Keep only the final model checkpoint and summary CSV.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. CONTACT / TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------------------------------------------------

If folders are not recognized:
    • Verify that ".tif" files exist in post-event/ and target/.
    • Check paths printed in the first cell of each notebook.
    • Ensure no hidden system folders were created during extraction.

If decoding issues appear in CrisisMMD TSVs:
    • The notebook contains a fallback UTF-8 handler.
    • No manual edits are needed.
